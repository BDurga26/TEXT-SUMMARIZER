A text summarizer is a tool or algorithm that condenses a large body of text into a shorter version while retaining the most important information. <br>
It extracts key ideas, concepts, or sentences from the original content, reducing its length without losing its essential meaning.<br>

How the Python Extractive Summarizer Works: <br>

Tokenization: The input text is broken down into individual sentences and words. This allows the algorithm to process the text on a granular level. <br>
Stopword Removal: Common, less meaningful words (like "the", "and", etc.) are removed to focus on the more important terms. <br>
Word Frequency Calculation: The importance of words is determined by their frequency in the text. Words that appear more frequently (excluding stopwords) are considered more significant.<br>
Sentence Scoring: Each sentence is scored based on the importance of the words it contains. Sentences with more high-frequency words are given higher scores.<br>
Summary Generation: Sentences with the highest scores are selected to form the summary. You can control the length of the summary by adjusting the percentage of the text to retain (e.g., 30% of the original text).<br>
